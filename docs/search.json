Randi’s office hours will be held on Thursdays 2:45p-4:00p, Fridays 10:50a-12:05p, or by appointment.\n\n\n\n\nThis course provides students with an overview of statistical methods needed for scientific research. Our discussions will focus primarily on the basic principles of the design of experiments and observational studies, standard balanced designs, extensions of these designs, and the analysis of data collected under these designs. Most physical, biological, and social processes, produce variable results. This variability can often be quantified and decomposed in ways that enhance our understanding of the process and facilitate decision making. Statisticians and Data Scientists use four steps to quantify and interpret this variability. The steps are:\n\nFormulate a statistical question about the process,\nDesign a data collection procedure, or comparison scheme, to answer the question,\nCollect and analyze the data, and\nInterpret and communicate the results in written, visual, and oral forms.\n\nOne major objective of this course is to give you practice with all four of these steps. Developing our statistical thinking around the factors that produce variability in observations is a key goal of all statistic courses. SDS 290 course goals:\n\nDistinguish between observational and experimental studies, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of each.\nExplain the three design principles: random assignment, blocking, factorial crossing.\nIdentify the factor structures of the four basic experimental designs: 1) One-way Basic Factorial, 2) One-way Complete Block, 3) Two-way Basic Factorial, and 4) Split Plot/Repeated Measures.\nRecognize potential sources of confounding and selection bias.\nCombine the four basic designs to recommend, recognize, and create new designs.\nCarry out, document, and explain a randomization plan for a survey or an experiment.\nAnalyze data using R statistical software:\n\nName and be able to check the six Fisher Assumptions.\nCalculate and interpret an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table for each of the four basic designs.\nCheck for and interpret interactions between variables.\n\n\nPrerequisite: An introductory statistics such as SDS 220/201, ECO 220, or equivalent.\n\n\n\n\nSTAT2: Modeling with Regression and ANOVA, Second Edition by Ann R. Cannon, George W. Cobb, and Bradley A. Hartlaub. ISBN-13: 978-1319054076.\n\n[PDFs provided on moodle] Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiments, by George Cobb. Hardcover edition published by John Wiley & Sons, 1998, ISBN: 978-0-470-41216-9.\n\nThe first few chapters of the Cobb book are provided as PDFs on our course Moodle page. We will mostly be using the Stat2 book but will supplement with the Cobb book. It is very important that you read the textbook before every class—time in class will be devoted to jumping right into using the ideas presented in the text. The textbook is full of great examples of real statistical studies.\n\n\n\nAll class sessions will be focused on active learning activities and there will be less lecturing. We will spend class time discussing your questions, looking at other examples, doing homework problems, and doing activities. With this semi-flipped class structure, it is VERY important that you do the assigned readings before coming to class. To this end, I will be starting most class sessions with questions about the readings to encourage you to keep up with the reading and to synthesize your thoughts before we begin class. On some class sessions, I will be giving mini-lectures, but they will often be focused statistical computing in R. Many activities will be designed to give you experience using statistical software to do the extensive computations most statistical analyses require. The computer is faster and more accurate than we are at doing arithmetic and graphs, but we have to know what arithmetic and which graphs will be useful.\nThe primary way you will get information about this course is from the course website. The course website will be regularly updated with handouts, project information, assignments, and other course resources. All assignments will be submitted via Moodle. Finally, this course will use Slack to communicate including announcements, discussions about extra credit events, group project channels, and other uses as the semester progresses."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nAttendance\nParticipation has two components: 1) being present and 2) engaging in class activities. Your participation is an important part of the process of learning statistics, and we need you in class to help stimulate discussion. You can make a valuable contribution to the discussion by bringing up connections between our work and study designs you have seen in other courses, in the newspaper, or in research literature. I realize that you won’t always be able to get to class and I ask that if you cannot make it to class that you please let me know why via a Slack direct message. There be many different ways to participate in this course (Slack, office hours, group projects, etc.) and you can demonstrate your participation in a combination of ways.\n\n\nCollaboration\nMuch of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for exams. However, every word that you write must be your own. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit. No interaction with anyone but the instructor and course assistant is allowed on any exams. All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code, which Smith has had since 1944.\n\n\nAcademic Honor Code Statement\nYou must always provide appropriate citations for others’ work and ideas. Giving other scholars due credit in your written and oral communication is a fundamental social gesture in academic work—a way for us to acknowledge each other’s scholarship and signify that we respect each other. We’ll treat AI code-completion tools as “collaborators” in this class. Whenever you get help with your programming tasks or writing, it is crucial to provide clear and transparent attribution. Include a comment or annotation in your code and add citations in your text specifying that certain sections were generated with the help of an AI code-completion tool. In general, I prefer you to do the work on your own without the aid of generative AI tools.\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, or other infractions, will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. You must always provide appropriate citations for others’ work and ideas. Giving other scholars due credit in your written and oral communication is a fundamental social gesture in academic work—a way for us to acknowledge each other’s scholarship and signify that we respect each other.\nFrom the Smith honor code website:\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.\n\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\nClassroom Environment\nRealizing the benefits of a diverse space can only occur if we create a climate of psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999). To this end, we will always be respectful of one another. Together we should have the goal of creating an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and opinions. To this end, I value “half-formed,” informal thoughts—sometimes a deeper understanding is reached via communicating ideas before they are perfectly polished.\nPlease let me know your gender pronouns however you prefer. In your written work for this class I am fine with (even encourage) the use of “they,” “their,” or simply “she” instead of “his or her” or “he or she.” Just please do not write “he,” “his” or “himself” when referring to all people. We also should also not say “you guys” when referring to a mixed-gender group, or refer to women as “girls.”\n\n\nAccommodations\nEveryone should have all that they need to succeed in this course. Please send me your accommodation letter, or have the Disability Office work with me. If you need to register for accommodations, please contact the Disability Services office at ODS@smith.edu. Please check out the office website for more information. Smith provides flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Smith College Disability Services office, College Hall 104; phone: (413) 585-2071 (voice, TTY, TDD). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation.\nIf you have special needs concerning quiz taking, please bring documentation of your needs and make an appointment to discuss them with me, at least ONE WEEK BEFORE the first exam. That will give me time to provide accommodation for your needs."

    "section": "Assignments",
    "text": "Assignments\n\nHomework [40%]: Weekly homework will be due on Fridays by 11:55p on Moodle. Late homework will NOT be accepted except in cases of a family or personal health emergency. Homework will be a combination of problems sets from the book and statistical computation exercises in R. I recommend that you form study groups of 3 or 4 students from the class, and get together outside of class to discuss the homework. Each of you should try the exercises on your own and then get together to discuss your work. This process helps you to develop your own way of thinking about statistics questions before hearing how others think. I will be dropping the lowest homework grade at the end of the term.\nParticipation [10%]: Active participation in class and regular attendance will comprise 10% of your grade. Most class periods will begin with questions from the reading for that day. Participating in the discussion about the readings is a great way to demonstrate engagement. Reading before class will help us move towards a “flipped” classroom. In non-flipped classrooms, students attend lectures and are asked to apply the material outside of class in the form of homework assignments. But often students need the most help from professors when they are in the midst of applying the material (Bergman & Sams, 2012). In flipped classrooms, students are asked to learn the facts at home and do the application in class. There will be many ways to demonstrate engagement throughout the term.\nExams [20%]: There will be two take home exams throughout the term. See the schedule for tentative dates of these exams. They will usually be distributed on a Tuesday and due that Friday. You will have time in class to work on the exams.\nMini Projects and Presentations [30% split as 10% MP1 + 20% MP2]: There will two mini projects during the semester. The first mini project (MP1) will be completed individually and the second mini project (MP2) will be completed in groups of about three. For these projects, you and your group will be posing your own research questions and designing an experiment. The specific content of your mini projects will vary, but all projects will consist of designing an experiment (or appropriate observational study), collecting and analyzing data, and writing a technical report on your study. For MP2 each group of three students will complete an experiment together. During the last week of class, you (and your group) will create short presentation of your study and record it or present it live to the class. We’ll talk more about the project as the term proceeds and detailed instructions for the projects will be posted on the course website.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercent of Total\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n40%\nFridays\n\n\nParticipation\n10%\nDaily\n\n\nExams\n20%\nMar 14 and May 2\n\n\nMini Project 1\n10%\nMar 29\n\n\nMini Project 2\n20%\nMay 10\n\n\nFinal Grade\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nWhen we grade your written work, I am looking for problem solutions that are technically correct and reasoning that is clearly explained. Numerically correct answers, alone, are not sufficient on homework or exams. I value neatness and brief, clear, well-organized answers that explain your thinking. If the grader cannot read or follow your work, she cannot give you credit for it. The grader will check each homework submission for completeness and grade a subset of the exercises. Homework answer keys will be posted on Moodle after the due date.\n\n\nAssignment Late Policy\nFor every day late on the written assignments I will reduce your grade for that assignment by 1/3 letter grade (i.e., if you wrote a B+ report, but turned it in 1 day late, you’ll get a B. Two days late? B-, and so forth). I will not accept any late final group research reports.\n\n\nFinal Grade Brackets\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nA\n95-100%\n\n\nA-\n90-95%\n\n\nB+\n87-89%\n\n\nB\n83-86%\n\n\nB-\n80-82%\n\n\nC+\n77-79%\n\n\nC\n73-76%\n\n\nC-\n70-72%\n\n\nD+\n60-66%\n\n\nD\n67-69%\n\n\nE\n59% and below"

    "text": "Resources\n\nCourse Website and Moodle\nThe course website will be regularly updated with lecture slides, project information, assignments, and other course resources. Assignments and grades will be submitted via Moodle. You should check both regularly.\n\n\nComputing\nThe use of the R statistical computing environment with the RStudio interface is thoroughly integrated into the course. You have two options for using RStudio:\n\nThe server version of RStudio on the web. The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer with a web browser (Firefox is recommended) and an Internet connection.\nA desktop version of RStudio installed on your machine. The downside to this approach is that your work is only stored locally, and you will have to manage your own installation.\n\nNote that you do not have to choose one or the other – you may use both. However, it is important that you understand the distinction so that you can keep track of your work. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source, and are installed on most computer labs on campus. Please see the Resources page for help with R.\n\n\nUse of Technology during Class\nAs we will always be using our computers to attend this course, I hope it goes without saying that while the class is in session, you should resist the temptation to use your computer or cell phone for personal email, web browsing, social media, or any activity that’s not related to the class.\n\n\nWriting\nYour ability to communicate results, which may be technical in nature, to your audience, which is likely to be non-technical, is critical to your success as a data analyst. The assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing.\n\n\nExtra Help\nThere are Statistics TAs available from 7:00-9:00pm on Sunday–Thursday evenings in Sabin-Reed 301. In addition, the Spinelli Center for Quantitative Learning supports students doing quantitative work across the curriculum. Your fellow students are also an excellent source for explanations, tips, etc.\n\n\nTentative Schedule\nPlease refer to the complete day-to-day schedule for more detailed information."

The four diets were glucose and fructose (6-carbon atoms), sucrose (12-carbon), and a control (2% agar). The experimenter prepared two dishes with each diet, divided the leafhoppers into eight groups of equal size, and then randomly assigned them to dishes.

An experiment was conducted to compare the effects of four sugar diets on the survival of leafhoppers. The four diets were glucose and fructose (6-carbon atoms), sucrose (12-carbon), and a control (2% agar). The experimenter prepared two dishes with each diet, divided the leafhoppers into eight groups of equal size, and then randomly assigned them to dishes. Then she counted the number of days until half the insects had died in each group."

    "text": "The learning goals of this first mini project are\n\nto solidify your understanding of what a true randomized experiment is,\nto learn how to use the Qualtrics software to deliver experiments, and\nto gain experience with analyzing the data generated from an experiment.\n\nYou will conduct an online experimental study using survey methodology. Your experiments will be set up using the Qualtrics survey platform. Your experiments will utilize vingettes or very simple visual stimuli presentation.\nYour study is required to be experimental, meaning you will manipulate a factor and randomly assign levels of that factor to experimental units (people). For this first mini project you must employ a randomized one-way design. Your factor must have at least three levels. You will be creating at least three carefully controlled conditions (i.e., three vignettes). These three (or more) conditions will be randomly assigned to people (fellow classmates). They are your “experimental units”.\nThis mini project will require you to design a one-way study, implement that study in Qualtrics, collect and analyze relevant data, and hand in a short written report describing your study and its findings. Your project will involve fitting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model and checking the ANOVA conditions. ANOVA is the primary statistical technique we are learning in this course. The project is an opportunity to apply and synthesize the material we are learning in class to a specific context. It will also give you the opportunity to show off what you have learned about data analysis, visualization, and variance decomposition in this course and from other SDS courses you may have taken. These projects are a major component of the class, and successful completion is required to pass.\n\nResearch Questions\nAfter settling on a research question, you will learn how to use Qualtrics and begin creating your experimental stimuli. Reading chapter four of the Cobb textbook (PDF on Moodle) could be helpful as you decide on the content of your study.\nPicking a good research question might be tricky. But start by brain storming things about people that you are interested in. Perhaps you are interested in how stressful people perceive different situations to be, or their helping behavior given different characteristics of a person in need. You might also assess health behaviors — for example, making judgements about which exercises to do, or foods to eat, or which situations might lead people to be more or less likely to want to get vaccinated. Starting with something you are curious about with regards to your own behavior is often an interesting place to start. When choosing your research question the most important feature is that you would be able to write short (two or three sentences) vignettes, varying the scenarios, characteristics, features, etc., to answer your question. Secondary in importance is how interested you are in the question, and then as a distant third would be how important your research question is for society. This is not the time for earth shattering research discoveries. Just make it something very doable that you capture your interest for a few weeks. It could even be something that makes you smile…like kittens and puppies.\n\n\nHypotheses\nThe topics I list above are meant to get you started, you should pose the question you want to answer as precisely as possible at the outset. Next, identify the factor of interest, the levels of this factor (i.e., treatment conditions), and think about how you will measure your response variable. You should also make hypotheses, a priori (before you collect and analyze the data), about the results you expect to see. Each design comes with a set of questions that it can answer.\n\n\nGeneral Rules\nYou may discuss your project with other students, but each of you will have a different topic, so there is a limit to how much you can help each other. You may consult other sources for information about the non-statistical, substantive issues in your problem, but you should credit these sources in your report. Feel free to consult Randi or the Stats TAs about statistical questions.\n\n\nSubmission\nAll deliverables must be submitted electronically via Moodle by the due date. Please submit\n\nyour exported Qualtrics survey experiment,\nthe cleaned data generated by your experiment,\nthe .qmd file you used to create your report, and\nyour project technical report as a PDF file.\n\n\n\nTechnical Report\n\nContent\nYou should not need to present all of the R code that you wrote throughout the process of working on this project. Rather, the technical report should contain the minimal set of R code that is necessary to understand your results and findings in full. If you make a claim, it must be justified by explicit calculation. A knowledgeable reviewer should be able to compile your .qmd file without modification, and verify every statement that you have made. All of the R code necessary to produce your figures and tables must appear in the technical report. In short, the technical report should enable a reviewer to reproduce your work in full.\n\n\nTone\nThis document should be written for peer reviewers. You should aim for a level of complexity that is more statistically sophisticated than an article in the Science section of The New York Times, but less sophisticated than an academic journal. For example, you may use terms that that you will likely never see in the Times (e.g. bootstrap), but should not dwell on technical points with no obvious ramifications for the reader (e.g. reporting why the F-distribution is used for ratios of chi-square distributed random variables). Your goal for this paper is to convince a statistically-minded reader (e.g. a student in this class, a student from another school who has taken an introductory statistics class) that you have addressed your research question in a meaningful way. Even a reader with no background in statistics should be able to read your paper and get the gist of it.\n\n\nFormat\nYour technical report should follow this basic format:\n\nIntroduction: an overview of your project. In a paragraph or two, you should explain clearly and precisely what your research question(s) are and what hypotheses you have about them.\nMethod: a detailed description of your study design. Describe the factor, each level, etc. Here is where you also describe your materials/stimuli. What were your experimental units? How did you measure your responses variable? How did you deliver your manipulation? The method section of a research study is extremely important for others to assess the validity of your findings and to replicate what you found in future studies.\nResults: an explanation of what your model tells us about the research question. You will be using ANOVA here, but also present visualizations that show the data and test the ANOVA conditions. You should interpret effect sizes and CIs in context and explain their relevance. You should also do any corrections for multiple comparisons. What does your model tell us that we didn’t already know before? You also want to include null results, but be careful about how you interpret them. For example, you may want to say something along the lines of: “we found no evidence that factor \\(A\\) has an effect on response variable \\(y\\).” On the other hand, you probably shouldn’t claim: “there is no effect of factor \\(A\\) on \\(y\\).”\nConclusion: a quick summary of your findings and a discussion of their limitations. First, remind the reader of the question that you originally set out to answer, and summarize your findings. Second, discuss the limitations of your model, and what could be done to improve it. You might also want to do the same for your data. This is your last opportunity to clarify the scope of your findings before a journalist misinterprets them and makes wild extrapolations! Protect yourself by being clear about what is not implied by your research.\n\n\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nThe technical report is not simply a dump of all the R code you wrote during this project. Rather, it is a narrative, with technical details, that describes how you addressed your research question. You should not present tables or figures without a written explanation of the information that is supposed to be conveyed by that table or figure. Keep in mind the distinction between data and information. Data is just numbers, whereas information is the result of analyzing that data and digesting it into meaningful ideas that human beings can understand. Your technical report should allow a reviewer to follow your steps from converting data into information. There is no limit to the length of the technical report, but it should not be longer than it needs to be. You will not receive extra credit for simply describing your data ad infinitum. For example, simply displaying a table with the means and standard deviations of your variables is not meaningful. Writing a sentence that reiterates the content of the table (e.g. “the mean of variable \\(x\\) was 34.5 and the standard deviation was 2.8…”) is equally meaningless. What you should strive to do is interpret these values in context (e.g. “although variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) have similar means, the spread of \\(x_1\\) is much larger, suggesting…”).\nYou should present figures and tables in your technical report in context. These items should be understandable on their own, in the sense that they have understandable titles, axis labels, legends, and captions. Someone glancing through your technical report should be able to make sense of your figures and tables without having to read the entire report. That said, you should also include a discussion of what you want the reader to learn from your figures and tables."

Smith relies on fencing to keep foot traffic off the lawns. But might there be a better way to do this that both invites use of lawns for picnicking and lounging, while protecting them from the dreaded goat paths that emerge from people cutting across them?\nManicured or Messy? - There is a general perception at Smith that Alumni are averse to changing the landscape, though data on this is scant. As we head into a new landscape master plan, the planning committee is curious about alumni perceptions of the landscape and whether those perceptions of our current (or anticipated) landscapes might change as alumni learn more about bioproductive landscapes and ecologically friendly landscapes. Does tolerance of “messy” or naturalistic design increase as people learn more about the benefits of less manicured landscapes?\nHow to get people to tell us stuff - We are in the early phases of wanting to make visitor feedback a normal part of our experience. These so-called talk-back spaces are also a place where the community talks to itself by putting their opinions, ideas, and experiences on display. Talk back spaces could be as simple as a prompt like, “What’s your favorite flower?” or more complicated. What’s the best approach to maximizing engagement with visitors via talk-back spaces?\nThe GardenGram - What factors increase engagement with the Botanic Garden’s social media accounts (i.e., Instagram)?\nInclusivity.com - Can small content changes on the website landing page influence perceptions on inclusivity?"

The abstract should not consist of more than 5 or 6 sentences, but should relate what you studied and what you found. It need only convey a general sense of what you actually did. The purpose of the abstract is to give a prospective reader enough information to decide if they want to read the full paper.\nIntroduction: an overview of your project. In a few paragraphs, you should explain clearly and precisely what your research question(s) are, why they are interesting, and what contribution you have made towards answering that question. It is important that you say why your study is novel, that is, how you are making steps to give previously unknown answers to important questions. Most readers never make it past the introduction, so this is your chance to hook the reader, and is in many ways the most important part of the paper! You need to cite at least three domain area papers (non-statistics) in your introduction. This is a great place to divide up the work! At the end of your introduction you should give an overview of some specifics of your study design, but not the full details, and end with your hypotheses.\nMethod: a much more detailed description of your study design. Describe the factors, each level, if there is crossing, blocks, etc. Here is where you also describe your materials/stimuli. What were your experimental units? How did you measure your responses variable? How did you deliver your manipulation? When did you collect your data and why was this choice made?

One of the objectives of this class is to give you experience conveying the results of a technical investigation to a non-technical audience in a way that they can understand. Whether you choose to stay in academia or pursue a career in industry, the ability to communicate clearly is of paramount importance. As a data analyst, the burden of proof is on you to convince your audience that what you are saying is true. If your audience (who may very well be less knowledgeable about statistics than you are) cannot understand your results or their interpretations, then the technical merit of your project is irrelevant.\nYou will make poster and present it in a poster session on the last day of class. Your goal should be to convey to your audience a clear understanding of your research question, along with a basic understanding of your model, and how well it addresses the research question you posed. I will give you more details about the poster as well as a poster template towards the end of the semester.\n\n\nGroup Dynamic Report\nIdeally, all group members would be equally involved and able and committed to the project. In reality, it doesn’t always work that way. We’d like to reward people fairly for their efforts in this group endeavor, because it’s inevitable that there will be variation in how high a priority people put on this class and how much effort they put into this project.\nTo this end, I’d like each of you (individually) to describe how well (or how poorly!) your project group worked together and shared the load. Also give some specific comments describing each member’s overall effort. Were there certain group members who really put out exceptional effort and deserve special recognition? Conversely, were there group members who really weren’t carrying their own weight? And then, at the end of your assessment, estimate the percentage of the total amount of work/effort done by each member. (Be sure your percentages sum to 100%!)\nFor example, suppose you have 3 group members: X, Y and Z. In the (unlikely) event that each member contributed equally, you could assign:\n\n33.3% for member X, 33.3% for member Y, and 33.3% for member Z\n\nOr in case person Z did twice as much work as each other member, you could assign:\n\n25% for member X, 25% for member Y, and 50% for member Z\n\nOr if member Y didn’t really do squat, you could assign:\n\n45% for member X, 10% for member Y, and 45% for member Z\n\nI’ll find a fair way to synthesize the (possibly conflicting) assessments within each group. And eventually I’ll find a way to fairly incorporate this assessment of effort and cooperation in each individual’s overall grade. Don’t pressure one another to give everyone glowing reports unless it’s warranted, and don’t feel pressured to share your reports with one another. Just be fair to yourselves and to one another. Let us know if you have any questions or if you run into any problems."

    "title": "Project Advice",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every project is different, but here is some general advice culled from years of experience.\n\nDO examine the distribution of your response variable. If it is non-normal, and your residuals are non-normal, you might want to try to transform the response variable. If the distribution of the response is right-skewed, then applying a log() transformation can often fix many problems. Read this\n\nDO think very carefully about how this changes the interpretation of your coefficients!! Try writing out the equation of the regression model. How does a one unit change in the explanatory translate into a one unit change in the response?\n\nDON’T spend a lot of time worrying about model selection (e.g. backwards-elimination, etc.). Remember that there is no “best” model, and model pruning is most useful for predicting future values of the response variable, which is not the focus of most of your projects. We are far more interested in your ability to correctly interpret model coefficients, assess statistical significance, and analyze residuals, then we are in your ability to do model selection.\nDO consider using logistic regression if your response variable is binary (see Ch. 6.3 in OpenIntro)\nDO include more advanced elements of R Markdown – such as images, table, links, and references – in your write-up where appropriate.\nDO investigate the bivariate relationships between your variables.

If you have a single variable that has a lot of missingness, can it be omitted from the model?\nDO disclose what you have done with the missing data. Were the data missing at random? Could the omission of these data have introduced some bias into your sample?\nDO spend a few minutes at the beginning of your talk introducing and motivating the problem, and providing context for your data and your question.\nDON’T forget to include a short limitation section at the end of your talk and your write-up.\nDON’T forget to do residual analysis.\nDO employ judicious rounding to make your results easier to read.\nDON’T forget about the Ecological Fallacy – if you have data about states or counties, you cannot interpret your results in terms of individual people.\nDO focus on relating to your audience what they can learn about the real-world problem from your model."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The learning goals of this second mini project are\n\nto design an experiment where you have flexibility in your design choices,\nto gain experience discussing design choices, and\nto gain experience distributing research work within a collaborative team, and\nto gain experience presenting your research work in an oral presentation format.\n\nYou will again conduct an online experimental study using survey methodology in groups of about 3. Your experiments will be set up using the Qualtrics survey platform. Your experiments will again utilize vingettes or very simple visual/audio stimuli presentation. In addition to submitting a technical report for MP2, your group will record a 5-to-10 minute presentation of your study, complete with slides. The professor will post these presentations on Moodle for your viewing pleasure.\nYour study is required to have at least one experimental factor, meaning you will manipulate this factor and randomly assign levels of those factors to units. For this second mini project you may pick any design your group likes, but you must have at least two factors of interest. These factors can be a mixture of experimental and observational factors. Your factors may each have more than two levels (but please do not go crazy — a more complex design means you will need a larger sample size!). You may also decide to have blocking in this study. If you decide to have blocks, by far the simplest way to do this with human subjects is by reusing materials, that is, the participants are your blocks and the units are time slots. You might then decide to have one between-subjects factor and one within-subjects factor (creating a split-plot/repeated measures design). Creating blocks with human subjects by grouping people based on some pre-survey responses is just not feasible in the MP2 time frame, I hope you see why…\nThis mini project will require you to design a new study, implement that study in Qualtrics, collect and analyze relevant data, and hand in a short written report describing your study and its findings. You will also submit a recorded presentation of slides. You will complete all of this work in groups of about 3 students. Your project will again involve fitting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The project is an opportunity to apply and synthesize the material we are learning in class to a specific context. It will also give you the opportunity to show off what you have learned about data analysis, visualization, and variance decomposition in this course and from other SDS courses you may have taken. These projects are a major component of the class, and successful completion is required to pass.\n\nResearch Questions\nAfter settling on a research question within your groups, you will begin creating your experimental stimuli and surveys in Qualtrics.\nPicking a good research question might be tricky. But start by brain storming things about people that you are interested in. You might start in your groups by going around an describing your MP1’s to each other. Same examples as for MP1 here: Perhaps you are interested in how stressful people perceive different situations to be, or their helping behavior given different characteristics of a person in need. You might also assess health behaviors — for example, making judgement about which exercises to do, or foods to eat, or which situations might lead people to be more or less likely to want to get vaccinated. Starting with something your are curious about with regards to your own behavior is often and interesting place to start. When choosing your research question the most important feature is that you would be able to write short (two or three sentences) vignettes, varying the scenarios, characteristics, features, etc., to answer your question. Although again I will not be grading specifically on creativity for this assignment, because you are working in groups of three, I expect that you’ll be able to settle on a research question/topic that is relatively interesting. You are welcome to expand on a topic that one of you did for MP1, in fact, I encourage this. A good research program often involves a set of experiments and studies that build on one another. Just make it something very doable that can capture your interest for the last few weeks of this course!\n\n\nHypotheses\nThe topics I list above are meant to get you started, you should pose the question you want to answer as precisely as possible at the outset. Next, identify the factor(s) of interest, the levels of these factors (i.e., treatment conditions), and think about how you will measure your response variable. You should also make hypotheses, a priori (before you collect and analyze the data), about the results you expect to see. Remember that each design comes with a set of questions that it can answer.\nYour hypotheses should include the direction of the effects you expect. For example, if one of your factors is nutrition and the levels are unhealthy and healthy presented across different vingettes, then you might hypothesize that people will rate the healthy condition as more nutritious than the unhealthy condition.\n\n\nGeneral Rules\nYou may discuss your project with students outside of your groups, but each group will have a different topic, so there is a limit to how much you can help each other. You may consult other sources for information about the non-statistical, substantive issues in your problem, but you should credit these sources in your report. Feel free to consult Randi or the Stats TAs about statistical questions.\n\n\nSubmission\nAll deliverables must be delivered electronically via Moodle by the due date. Please submit\n\nyour exported Qualtrics survey experiment,\nthe cleaned data generated by your experiment,\nthe .Rmd file you use to analyze your data,\na link to your presentation slides (Google slides) or powerpoint file, and\na video of your 10 to 15 minute presentation (Zoom is easiest. I want your faces to be visible).\n\nOnly one person from your group needs to submit. I will know who’s in which group and will record your grades accordingly.\n\n\nRecorded Oral Presentation\n\nContent\nYou should not need to present all of the R code that you wrote throughout the process of working on this project. Rather, the oral presentation should contain the minimal set of R code that is necessary to understand your results and findings in full. If you make a claim, it must be justified by explicit calculation. A knowledgeable reviewer should be able to compile your accompanying .Rmd file without modification, and verify every statement that you have made. All of the R code necessary to produce your figures and tables must appear in the accompanying .Rmd file. In short, the oral presentation and accompanying .Rmd file should enable a reviewer to reproduce your work in full.\n\n\nTone\nThis presentation should be recorded for peer reviewers and/or your professor. You should aim for a level of complexity that is more statistically sophisticated than an article in the Science section of The New York Times, but less sophisticated than an academic journal. For example, you may use terms that that you will likely never see in the Times (e.g. bootstrap), but should not dwell on technical points with no obvious ramifications for the listener (e.g. reporting why the F-distribution is used for ratios of chi-square distributed random variables). Your goal for this paper is to convince a statistically-minded listener (e.g. a student in this class, a student from another school who has taken an introductory statistics class that you have addressed your research question in a meaningful way. Even a listener with no background in statistics should be able to watch your presentation and get the gist of it.\n\n\nFormat\nYour oral presentation should follow this basic format:\n\nIntroduction: an overview of your project. In a few sentences, you should explain clearly and precisely what your research question(s) are and what hypotheses you have about them.\nMethod: a detailed description of your study design. Describe the factors, each level, if there is crossing, blocks, etc. Here is where you also describe your materials/stimuli. What were your experimental units? How did you measure your responses variable? How did you deliver your manipulation? The method section of a research study is extremely important for others to assess the validity of your findings and to replicate what you found in future studies.\nResults: an explanation of what your model tells us about the research question. You will be using ANOVA here, but also present visualization that show the data and test the ANOVA conditions. You should interpret effect sizes and CIs in context and explain their relevance. What does your model tell us that we didn’t already know before? You also want to include null results, but be careful about how you interpret them. For example, you may want to say something along the lines of: “we found no evidence that factor \\(A\\) has an effect on response variable \\(y\\).” On other hand, you probably shouldn’t claim: “there is no effect of factor \\(A\\) on \\(y\\).”\nConclusion: a quick summary of your findings and a discussion of their limitations. First, remind the reader of the question that you originally set out to answer, and summarize your findings. Second, discuss the limitations of your model, and what could be done to improve it. You might also want to do the same for your data. This is your last opportunity to clarify the scope of your findings before a journalist misinterprets them and makes wild extrapolations! Protect yourself by being clear about what is not implied by your research. Lastly, include thoughts about future directions for you next research project in this line of inquiry.\n\n\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nThe oral presentation is not simply a dump of all the R code you wrote during this project. Rather, it is a narrative, with technical details, that describes how you addressed your research question. You should not present tables or figures without giving an explanation of the information that is supposed to be conveyed by that table or figure. Keep in mind the distinction between data and information. Data is just numbers, whereas information is the result of analyzing that data and digesting it into meaningful ideas that human beings can understand. Your presentation should allow a reviewer to follow your steps from converting data into information. The presentation should be about 8 to 10 minutes. You will not receive extra credit for simply describing your data ad infinitum. For example, simply displaying a table with the means and standard deviations of your variables is not meaningful. Writing a sentence that reiterates the content of the table (e.g. “the mean of variable \\(x\\) was 34.5 and the standard deviation was 2.8…”) is equally meaningless. What you should strive to do is interpret these values in context (e.g. “although variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) have similar means, the spread of \\(x_1\\) is much larger, suggesting…”).\nIf you do choose to include figures and/or tables, and I think you should, you should present figures and tables in your presentation in context. These items should be understandable on their own, in the sense that they have understandable titles, axis labels, legends, and captions. Someone glancing through your presentation should be able to make sense of your figures and tables without having to read the entire report. That said, you should also include a discussion of what you want the reader to learn from your figures and tables."

Scientists wondered if they could get babies to walk sooner by prescribing a set of special exercises. They decided to compare babies given special exercises with a control group of babies. But the scientists recognized that just showing an interest in the babies and their parents could cause a placebo effect. That is, the attention alone could influence parents and their babies in ways that would shorten the time to walk. 24 babies were randomly assigned to one of four conditions:\n\nSpecial exercises: Shown special exercises and parents are called weekly and asked it their baby was walking.\nExercise control: No special exercises but parents were told to have baby exercise for 15 min every day. Parents were called each week.\nWeekly report: No exercises but parents were called each week.\nFinal report: Only a report at the end on the study.\n\nThey recorded the age (in months) the babies first walked."

If we collected another sample we would see slightly different mean birth weights for the four groups. We need to consider if the group differences we see in this sample are greater than the differences we would expect from sample to sample."

    "text": "Inappropriate Insects\nModern zoos try to reproduce natural habitats in their exhibits as much as possible. They try to use appropriate plants, but these plants can be infested with inappropriate insects. Cycads (plants that look vaguely like palms) can be infected with mealybugs, and the zoo wishes to test three treatments: 1) water, 2) horticultural oil, and 3) fungal spores in water. Nine infested cycads are taken to the testing area. Three branches are randomly selected from each tree, and 3 cm by 3 cm patches are marked on each branch. The number of mealybugs on the patch is counted. The three treatments then get randomly assigned to the three branches for each tree. After three days the mealybugs are counted again. The change in number of mealybugs is computed (\\(before-after\\))."

    "text": "MORE Design Terminology\n\nThe two factors Trees and Treatment are crossed. This means that we collect data on all combinations of Trees and Treatment. A cell is a particular combination.\nMain effect refers to the effect for a single factor. For a block design there are two sets of main effects, for blocks and for treatments (e.g., Trees and Treatment).\nThe two sets of main effects are called additive if each treatment adds or subtracts the same amount to the response variable for all blocks.\nA factor of interest is Treatment, which is directly related to the goal of the study. A nuisance factor is Trees which is included as a factor only because it is a source of variation and its inclusion will reduce the sum of squares for error (residuals).\nTypically, factors of interest are fixed, which means their effects are an unknown constant. Nuisance factors are random, which means their effects behave according to chance (the levels themselves are samples from a population)."

You might start by choosing a response that narrows down what you mean by “better.” One feature of healthy lungs is tracheobronchial clearance—how fast they get rid of nasty stuff. To test this idea, investigators found 7 sets of mono-zygotic twins where one was living in the country and one in the city. Each person inhaled an aerosol of radioactive Teflon particles. Then the level of radioactivity was measured once right after inhaling, and again an hour later. The percent of the original radioactivity remaining was calculated."

An experiment was conducted to compare the effects of four sugar diets on the survival of leafhoppers. The four diets were glucose and fructose (6-carbon atoms), sucrose (12-carbon), and a control (2% agar). The experimenter prepared two dishes with each diet, divided the leafhoppers into eight groups of equal size, and then randomly assigned them to dishes. Then she counted the number of days until half the insects had died in each group."

Scientists wondered if they could get babies to walk sooner by prescribing a set of special exercises. They decided to compare babies given special exercises with a control group of babies. But the scientists recognized that just showing an interest in the babies and their parents could cause a placebo effect. That is, the attention alone could influence parents and their babies in ways that would shorten the time to walk. 24 babies were randomly assigned to one of four conditions:\n\nSpecial exercises: Shown special exercises and parents are called weekly and asked it their baby was walking.\nExercise control: No special exercises but parents were told to have baby exercise for 15 min every day. Parents were called each week.\nWeekly report: No exercises but parents were called each week.\nFinal report: Only a report at the end on the study.\n\nThey recorded the age (in months) the babies first walked."

You design your experiment in such a way that 3 piglets are randomly assigned to each of the 4 treatment conditions.

But pigs have bacteria living in their intestines that might prevent the uptake of vitamins, so you decided to give antibiotics to the pigs in one of two doses (0mg or 40 mg). You design your experiment in such a way that 3 piglets are randomly assigned to each of the 4 treatment conditions. You measure their weight every day, and take each pig’s average daily weight gain as your final number recorded."

    "text": "Warm-up: Swimsuit/Sweater Study\nObjectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) posits that American culture socializes women to adopt observers’ perspectives on their physical selves. This self-objectification is hypothesized to (a) produce body shame, which in turn leads to restrained eating, and (b) consume attentional resources, which is manifested in diminished mental performance on a math test. An experiment manipulated self-objectification by having participants try on a swimsuit or a sweater. Further, it tested 20 women and 20 men, in each condition, and found that the effects on math performance were present for women only."

All subjects perform four memory trials in random order, testing 4 different types of memory. The number of errors on each trial is recorded."
